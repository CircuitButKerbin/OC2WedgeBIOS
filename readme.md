#WedgeBIOS
This is a project to implement a more advanced bios, as a replacement to the regular
Lua BIOS EEPROM avalible within OpenComputers. It will implement things such as:
 - Secure Boot
 - Network Boot
 - Booting from Unmanaged Disks
 - Support for other processor Architechures
Whilist still supporting OpenOS & other operating systems utilizing the /init.lua booting method.
This BIOS will include a text-based config menu, akin to the ones you see on older computers.
